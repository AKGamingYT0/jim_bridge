2.0.15

- Fix old PSInv/QBInv stashes being wiped when it should be updating them
- Better breakout from opening inventory while crafting
- Unify isInventoryOpen() function to simply check for IsNuiFocused()
- Add clearStash() and doesItemExist() functions for future use
- Add warmenu.lua file for gta scaleform menus (loading is disabled by default)
- Move custom GTA native notify, skillcheck, target to separate files, can be used outside the script
- Complete refactor of framework shared info loading, now only does it once and then shares to scripts
- Added extra checks for ESX loading, should hopefully stop the coreloader line 317 error
